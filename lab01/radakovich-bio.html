    </head>

    <body>
        My name is Megan Radakovich. I am a dual Graphic Design & Information Management and Technology major, interested in typography and web design. Some of my accomplishments include creating three original typefaces and designing the logo and literature for a local political candidate in my hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio. I am skilled at using the Adobe Suite, and I consider myself very organized and responsible. Outside of work, I love doing arts and crafts, watching The West Wing or New Girl, and hanging out with the people I love. I also spend too much time scrolling through Pinterest, and I love going to garage sales to see what I can find.
