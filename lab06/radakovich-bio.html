        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        <p>
        My name is Megan Radakovich. I am a dual <strong>Graphic Design &amp; Information Management and Technology</strong> major, interested in typography and web design. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Some of my accomplishments include creating three original typefaces and designing the logo and literature for a local political candidate in my hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio. I am skilled at using the Adobe Suite, and I consider myself very organized and responsible.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Outside of work, I love:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>doing arts and crafts</li> 
            <li>watching The West Wing or New Girl</li>
            <li>hanging out with the people I love</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        I also spend too much time scrolling through Pinterest, and I love going to garage sales to see what I can find.
